# Fridge

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to work with ReST API and related
tools.

In this guide, we will:

-   write open API specification with the editor
-   generate a mock server
-   write tests
-   implement real server and client

## Tools

We will use the default [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/) editor. You can find it [here](https://editor.swagger.io). Also, there are a lot of extensions for text editors and IDEs like [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi). There are a lot of other options for the editor, e.g., run it locally in the docker or with NodeJS.

For the generation of the mock we also can use the same editor, but for educational purposes we will try [Postman](https://www.postman.com)

## Steps
